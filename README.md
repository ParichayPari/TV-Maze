# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Why choosen this project?
  Inspired by Netflix I decided to give a try on making a small TV show library app where I can search shows by Actors name or directly by show name.

## Tech stack used in this project.
    1. The app isa SPA(Single Page Application) created using create-react-app.
    2. additional depedency used: bootstrap ver: 5.2.1.
    
## How I made it?
  1. To develop the application I divided the App component into two sub-component as Navbar and Search.
  2. The search component consist of 2 child component namely Actors and Show.
  3. In order to keep track of states in my app, I used UseState hooks.
  4. The search bar will appear if any of the radio button is selected and the result will be show accordingly.

## Scope of Improvement:
  The app can be improvised into a large TV show, movies and related actors informational blog (with larger size API) where user will be able to search for the show or movie details and ratings and links to watch the shows
